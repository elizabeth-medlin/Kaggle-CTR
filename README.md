### Kaggle-CTR
This notebook contains my complete workflow for training an algorithm on the *https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/ctr-in-advertisement* dataset. 

1. Accessing the data via API,
2. Cleaning the data and formatting it for testing,
3. Fitting a decision tree algorithm on the data, and
4. Visualizing the resulting decision tree.

Not included in this notebook:
1. Hours of tangling with dtreeviz
2. Alternate training on a K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, another strong candidate for analysis of this data.
